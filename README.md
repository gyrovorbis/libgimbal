# Overview #
libGimbal aims to bring the high-level constructs and niceties of modern languages and their standard libraries to low-level C and C++, where they can be implemented with a focus on performance for embedded devices and game consoles. libGimbal includes features typically found in core application frameworks such as Foundation, QtCore, or GLib, or in languages such as C# or Java. At its core, libGimbal utilizes an object-oriented dynamic type system, which allows C to transcend its own language limitations and provides a flexible avenue for interoperability with other languages. An idiomatic modern C++20-based API built around the core is also currently under development. 

# Features #
libGimbal is split into a series of APIs, featuring:
- Containers and Data Structures
- Generic Algorithms 
- Custom Allocators
- Specialized Strings 
- Standard Library Utilities
- Preprocessor Programming
- Dynamic Type System 
- Threading and Concurrency
- Unit Test Framework

# Platforms #
libGimbal is being actively tested on the following targets:
- Windows 
- MacOS 
- Linux 
- Sega Dreamcast
- Nintendo Gamecube
- Sony PSP
- Sony PSVita
- WebAssembly
- iOS
- Android

# Compilers #
libGimbal is being built in CI with the following compilers:
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- GCC
- Clang
- MinGW-w64
- Emscripten

# Building #
Building is done with standard CMake, and all generators and mainstream compilers should be supported. You should be able to open CMakeLists.txt directly as a project file in most IDEs such as MSVC, XCode, Qt Creator, CLion, etc if you wish to build from a UI.

First, ensure submodules are installed with:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To build the project and its unit tests from the command-line, you can do the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DGBL_ENABLE_TESTS=ON ..
cmake --build . 
```

To build for Emscripten:
```
mkdir build
cd build
emcmake cmake -DGBL_ENABLE_TESTS=ON ..
cmake --build . 
```

# Bindings #
LibGimbal was specifically written with language interoperability in mind. As such, we will be happy to support and feature bindings to your favorite language. The following is a list of libraries which offer bindings between libGimbal and other languages:
